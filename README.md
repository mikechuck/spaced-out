# Spaced Out
### Team based space themed Rougelike

What started out as a sandbox to learn new things has turned into a full game idea!  

```prototype``` branch is being used to refresh the look and feel of the game, with the goal of creating a bare-bones working version.
This will include base game logic, players, networking, economy, win condition, etc.

Spec can be found in this google doc for gameplay details and milestones!

:warning: This is a work in progress, and am in the process of cleaning up much of the leftover and unused code :warning:
