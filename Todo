		- Start Server
			- On click:
				- Create new Server instance 
				- send "host" client id so only they can start it up
				- return info (IP, connection info), save info to GameManager
				- once server is started, run CreateClient to connect this player
		- Join Server
			- Server IP

	- Lobby UI:
		- Display server menu 
		- Display players in lobby
		- Start Game button
			- onclick: 
				- send rpc to server to have server load main scene

					- make sure to wait for all players to finish loading scene

- Main scene
